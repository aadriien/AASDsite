        <h2 class="FAQcategory">Common Traits & Behaviors</h2>
        
        <button class="accordion">Why do autistic people stim?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The repetitive and familiar nature of stimming can often 
                provide comfort during times of stress and overwhelm. It enables
                the individual to channel their energy into a controlled source,
                promoting focus and stability. But stimming does not only serve 
                to soothe; it may perhaps reflect a present physical or emotional 
                state, such as strong happiness, tiredness, etc. It can also be 
                the case that a person stims for no specific reason at all! 
                Regardless of the situation, so long as the stim is not injurious
                to the individual or to others, it is perfectly ordinary, healthy,
                and beautiful.</p>
            </div>

        <button class="accordion">Why do autistic people struggle with eye contact?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>While some autistic people are okay with eye contact, many 
                find the experience to be immensely uncomfortable and unpleasant,
                to the point of it being painful. Maintaining eye contact can 
                feel intense and overwhelming, especially with the added 
                pressure of social nuance that accompanies such intimacy. Put
                simply, it is vital to respect the choices and the needs of the 
                individual; they are still fully capable of listening to you 
                even if they are not consistently holding your gaze. There is 
                nothing wrong or offensive about avoiding eye contact, and it is 
                crucial that the boundaries of the individual are respected.</p>
            </div>

        <button class="accordion">Why do autistic people prefer routines?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Society as a whole has been designed to suit the needs of a 
                neurotypical population. This means that neurodivergent communities
                often feel out of place, which initiates lifelong struggles of 
                internalized distress. Largely as a result of this, routines
                allow autistic people to make sense of and cope with the chaos 
                of the unpredictable neurotypical world. Routines offer solace,
                reliability, and the opportunity for rest, given that there exists 
                a reassuring comfort in their familiarity.</p>
            </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">Why do autistic people have meltdowns?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Meltdowns occur when a person's threshold of tolerance has 
                been irrevocably passed. The neurotypical world tends to be 
                laced with complications that make neurodivergent life difficult,
                such as intense sensory stimuli (e.g. loud sounds, strong smells,
                large crowds), confusing social norms, systemic ableism, etc. 
                These stressors add up, and once they reach a certain point, the 
                autistic individual in question quite literally cannot maintain 
                composure for any longer. Meltdowns are incredibly painful and 
                embarrassing for the individual to experience; it is beyond 
                their control. Nobody should ever be punished or shamed for a 
                meltdown.</p>
            </div>

        <button class="accordion">Why do autistic people have specific passions?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>These are most commonly called "special interests"! Special
                interests are somewhat similar to stims in that they provide a
                source of comfort and familiarity. They enable the individual to
                focus their energy on a topic that is engaging and appealing,
                and they also serve as a great point of conversation. Simply put,
                autistic folks find joy, peace, and excitement in their special
                interests. They instill a sense of happiness and safety. So if 
                ever you want to initiate a discussion with an autistic person,
                asking about their interests is a great place to startâ€”you will 
                have the opportunity to learn something in greater depth, and 
                your interest in their passions will likely make their day!</p>

        <h2 class="FAQcategory">Practicing Good Allyship</h2>
        
        <button class="accordion">What language/terminology should I use?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>When describing someone with a diagnosis of ASD, identity-first
                language ("autistic person") is, according to the overwhelming
                majority of autistic people, preferred. Person-first language
                ("person with autism") has been popularized by the medical
                community and is commonly heard among allistic parents of
                autistic children, despite the fact that the autistic community
                has repeatedly spoken out against it. Yet each person has
                their own preference, so if possible, it is ideal to ask the 
                individual what they prefer for themselves. Generally speaking, 
                however, "autistic" is what works best in situations where you 
                are unsure of individual preference, as well as in situations
                where a larger community is referenced.</p>
