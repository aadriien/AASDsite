            <h4>noun / noun / adjective</h4>
            <p>
                A neurological condition, commonly considered to be a 
                developmental disorder, that affects the ways in which an 
                individual perceives and responds to their environment. Autism,
                or Autism Spectrum Disorder (abbreviated ASD), falls
                under the <a href="#neurodivergent">neurodivergent</a> umbrella, owing to the fact that it is
                simply a difference in the way that the nervous system processes
                information. ASD occurs naturally, and it serves as a 
                wonderful example of human biodiversity. ASD has been in 
                existence long before it was labeled by researchers, and its 
                unique traits have paved the way for major contributions to the 
                development and progression of humanity. ASD can present in 
                infinitely many diverse ways, and owing to the fact that 
                society has been structured around the <a href="#neurotypical">neurotypical</a> experience,
                many autistic self-advocates consider autism to be a disability.

        <li><br><h3 id="AAC">Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC):</h3>
            <h4>noun</h4>
            <p>
                A means by which an individual can communicate without having 
                to rely explicitly on verbal speech. More commonly referred to 
                by its abbreviation of AAC, Augmentative and Alternative 
                Communication can involve the use of an electronic device, a 
                paper/chart, a whiteboard, etc. AAC is typically used by a
                nonspeaking <a href="#neurodivergent">neurodivergent</a> population, but there are a number of
                verbal and partially verbal people who benefit from AAC. Such 
                communication tools can be of particular help during times of 
                <a href="#meltdown">meltdown</a> and <a href="#shutdown">shutdown</a>, as they enable the individual to convey 
                thoughts, needs, and experiences at a time when the brain may 
                not allow for fluid speech. AAC is just as valuable and authentic 
                as any other form of communication, and nobody should ever lose 
                access to, or be weaned off of, any communication tools that 
                provide comfort and support self-articulation.

        <li><br><h3 id="burnout">burnout:</h3>
            <h4>noun</h4>
            <p>
                A powerful state of exhaustion experienced by an <a href="#autism">autistic</a> 
                person, which, if left untreated, can last weeks, months, or even 
                years. A period of burnout can often look and feel similar to a 
                <a href="#shutdown">shutdown</a>, yet burnout involves a much lengthier, and 
                typically more vicious, cycle of repeated distress. Common 
                contributors to burnout can vary, but namely consist of instances 
                where the individual pushes themselves excessively, whether it 
                be at work/school, in social situations, in moments of sensory 
                processing, etc. Burnout is exacerbated by a determination to 
                keep going and to ignore one's needs (for example, neglecting to 
                wear headphones or sunglasses in overwhelming settings for fear 
                of being judged). Burnout is only ever alleviated when the 
                individual implements a thorough period of rest, where they can 
                address their needs and be free of any pressure to perform.

        <li><br><h3 id="inspiration">inspiration porn:</h3>
            <h4>noun</h4>
            <p>
                A process by which the lives and actions of disabled people are 
                glorified for the sake of uplifting the spirits of non-disabled 
                people. It occurs when disabled people are condescendingly praised 
                for engaging in various (oftentimes perfectly ordinary) activities. 
                They may be labeled as "inspirational", "heroic", or any other 
                number of descriptors, simply because their disability singles them 
                out as being different from others around them. Common examples 
                include but are not limited to: taking a disabled person to prom 
                and very publicly sharing the news to others, posting videos 
                online of a Deaf or Hard of Hearing person using hearing aids 
                for the first time, viewing photos of people with mobility 
                impairments engaging in athletics for the sake of giving oneself 
                a motivational boost, etc. In short, if the idea of a disabled 
                person participating in an activity gives you a "feel-good" 
                pick-me-up, then you are likely perpetuating inspiration porn. 
                Yet inspiration porn is incredibly ableist, as it dehumanizes the 
                individual by suggesting that the mere existence of their disability 
                renders them an object of inspiration. It allows non-disabled 
                people to feel better about themselves becauses it reinforces 
                their illusion of disability being some bad or inferior obstacle 
                to overcome.

        <li><br><h3 id="meltdown">meltdown:</h3>
            <h4>noun</h4>
            <p>
                An often explosive loss of control that is experienced by 
                someone who has surpassed their threshold of tolerance. Some 
                visible displays of an <a href="#autism">autistic</a> meltdown include, but are not 
                limited to, crying, screaming, injuring oneself/others, covering 
                one's ears/eyes, and stimming, though each meltdown is 
                specific to the individual. Meltdowns are extremely agonizing 
                for the individual to experience, and are often accompanied by 
                later feelings of shame, regret, tiredness, etc. They can be 
                triggered by sensory overwhelm, emotional and social overwhelm, 
                miscommunication, change in routine, and more. Meltdowns are 
                completely involuntary, and always unwanted. Nobody should 
                ever be punished for their meltdowns.

        <li><br><h3 id="neurodivergent">neurodivergence / neurodivergent:</h3>
            <h4>noun / adjective</h4>
            <p>
                A variation in the way that an individual's nervous system 
                (most notably their brain) functions. Someone who is neurodivergent
                has a neurology that operates differently from that which is 
                found in the majority of the population. Different people have 
                different perceptions of what this term entails, but generally,
                neurodivergence is considered to include conditions such as, but 
                not necessarily limited to, <a href="#autism">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</a>, 
                Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Tourette
                Syndrome (TS), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), dyslexia, 
                dyscalculia, dyspraxia, and epilepsy. There exists debate as to 
                whether certain mental health diagnoses should be classified
                under the umbrella of neurodivergence.

        <li><br><h3 id="neurodiversity">neurodiversity / neurodiverse:</h3>
            <h4>noun / adjective</h4>
            <p>
                The collection of diverse neurological experiences. Neurodiversity 
                exists in a group where some people are <a href="#neurotypical">neurotypical</a> and others 
                are <a href="#neurodivergent">neurodivergent</a>. It represents the many varied ways in which 
                different individuals in a community can perceive and interact 
                with the world. Neurodiversity is important for biodiversity,
                and it keeps society healthy and flourishing. There is no one 
                neurotype that is superior to others.

        <li><br><h3 id="neurotypical">neurotypical:</h3>
            <h4>adjective, noun</h4>
            <p>
                A person whose neurology is most commonly found in the majority 
                of individuals in the human population. This means that a 
                neurotypical person's nervous system perceives and responds to 
                the environment in a way that is similar to what is found in most other 
                individuals. Because neurotypicals are expected to constitute the 
                majority, our society is nearly always tailored to the neurotypical
                experience, which can leave little room for <a href="#neurodivergent">neurodivergent</a>
                communities to find comfort and achieve success.

            <h4>noun</h4>
            <p>
                A kind of internalized <a href="#meltdown">meltdown</a>. The triggers of a shutdown are 
                often the same as those of a <a href="#meltdown">meltdown</a>, though shutdowns are 
                usually harder for an outsider to notice. Some visible displays
                of an <a href="#autism">autistic</a> shutdown include, but are not limited to, crying,
                spacing out, becoming very still, becoming unresponsive or 
                otherwise delayed, and losing the ability to speak, though, 
                like <a href="#meltdown">meltdowns</a>, shutdowns are specific to the individual. Many 
                compare shutdowns to an autopilot that takes over when the 
                body and brain cannot push themselves any further. These 
                internalized experiences are more common in adults, and they are 
                just as emotionally and physically taxing to endure as a 
                <a href="#meltdown">meltdown</a>.

                an <a href="#autism">autistic</a> individual joy, comfort, and amusement. Many <a href="#autism">autistic</a> 
                people feel very passionate about their special interests, and 
                they can thus spend lengthy periods of time learning about, and 
                subsequently communicating about, whichever topics attract their 
                attention. Some people retain their special interests for years,
                while others may find new passions over the course of days. An 
                individual can have multiple, few, or even no special interests.

                A self-stimulatory behavior that is often performed repetitively.
                Stimming is done in a number of ways. It can involve interacting 
                with one's body, and it can also involve interacting with fidget toys.
                Certain stims, such as rocking back and forth, flapping one's 
                hands, making sound, spinning in circles, etc. are more visible.
                Other stims, such as bouncing one's leg, rubbing a soft object,
                twirling one's hair, clearing one's throat, viewing a colorful
                object, etc. are less visible, and therefore are less frequently
                noticed. Many <a href="#neurotypical">neurotypicals</a> engage in some small degree of 
                stimming, whereas <a href="#neurodivergent">neurodivergent</a> individuals tend to stim more 
                frequently and more visibly. Stimming is natural and beautiful.
